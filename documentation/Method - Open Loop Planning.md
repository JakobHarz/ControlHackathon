# (Method) Open Loop Planning

<img src="_misc/openLoop.svg" width="800"/>



We are considering a system, which we model using an ordinary differential equation 

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dot{x} = f(x,u)
\end{aligned}
$$

with state $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$, and control $u\in \mathbb{R}^{n_u}$. We want to find a find a control strategy $u(t)$ such that the trajectory $x(t)$ that the system (hopefully) follows in the future, is optimal in the sense of some cost function. For this we use so called *direct methods*, which involve first discretizing the dynamics and their solution and then formulating the optimal control task into a nonlinear program.
## Discrete Dynamics

We approximate the continuous state trajectory $x(t)$ on grid points $t_0, t_1, \dots, t_k, t_{k+1}, \dots$ as $x(t_k) \approx x_k$. Also, for simplicity, we assume that over each interval the control is constant: $u(t) = u_k, \forall  t \in [t_k, t_{k+1}]$, and that the intervals have the same constant duration, $h = t_{k+1} - t_k$.
Then we can find discrete dynamics:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x_{k+1} = F(x_k, u_k)
\end{aligned}
$$

which can be obtained from a continuous-time ODE using a single (or multiple) steps of a one-step integration method. A commonly used integration method is the Runge-Kutta method of order 4:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	k_1 &= f(x_k, u_k) \\
	k_2 &= f\left(x_k + \frac{h}{2}k_1, u_k\right) \\
	k_3 &= f\left(x_k + \frac{h}{2}k_2, u_k\right) \\
	k_4 &= f\left(x_k + h k_3, u_k\right) \\
	x_{k+1} &= x_k + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \\
		    &= F(x_k, u_k)
\end{aligned}
$$



## Discrete Optimal Control Problem
<img src="_misc/DOCP.png" width="700"/>

Given the system model and constraints, a quite generic discrete time optimal control problem can be formulated as the following constrained NLP:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x_0,u_0,x_1,u_1} &\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} l_k(x_k,u_k) + E(x_N) \\
\text{s.t.}\quad & 0 = x_0 - \bar{x}_ 0 \\&  0 = x_{k+1} - F(x_k, u_k), \quad &k=0,\dots,N-1 \\
&  0 \geq h(x_k, u_k), \quad &k=0,\dots,N-1 
\end{aligned}
$$

The decision variables of the problem contain the *discrete* state and control trajectories on the time grid. We have $N+1$ variables 

$$\begin{aligned}x_0,x_1, \dots, x_N\end{aligned}$$ 

for the state trajectory each of which is of a vector of $n_x$ variables, and $N$ variables for  the control trajectory:

$$\begin{aligned}
u_0, u_1, \dots, u_{N-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

each of which is a vector of size $n_u$.
The trajectory should satisfy some constraints, for example simple bounds, this is expressed in the inequality for each state and control pair

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(x_k, u_k) \leq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
  
Most importantly, the trajectory that we plan, should satisfy the discrete dynamics of the system, and should start at some initial point $\bar{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$, given by the equality constraints:

$$
\begin{aligned}& 0 = x_0 - \bar{x}_ 0 \\
&  0 = x_{k+1} - F(x_k, u_k), \quad &k=0,\dots,N-1 \end{aligned}
$$

The cost function is divided into a *stage cost*  $l(x_k, u_k)$ for each interval and a terminal cost $E(x_N)$ for the terminal node. A very common example is a *tracking cost* 
$$
\begin{aligned}\sum (x_k - \bar{x}_ k)^\top Q (x_k - \bar{x}_ k) + (u_k - \bar{u}_ k)^\top R (u_k - \bar{u}_ k) \end{aligned}
$$
  
when we want to find a control which makes the system follow a given reference of states $\bar{x}_0, \bar{x}_1, \dots,$  and controls  $\bar{u}_0, \bar{u}_1, \dots,$. Here $Q$ and $R$ are (typically diagonal) *weighting matrices*, to emphasise the importance of either control or state tracking.

## Practical Solution of the Nonlinear Programm
The nonlinear program above is of the general form

$$
\begin{aligned}\min_w\quad& f(w) \\
\text{s.t.}\quad& 0 = g(w) \\
& 0 \leq h(w)
\end{aligned}
$$

with variables $w$, objective function $f$, equality constraints $g$ and inequality constraints $h$. Such an NLP can be formulated and solved using a number of tools:
- The `Python/Matlab` framework [`CasAdi`](https://web.casadi.org/) which, when installed for Python using `pip install casadi` comes natively with the very robust solver `IPOPT`which is called using the `nlpsol` function.
- The Python library `scipy`,  provides the function [`scipy.optimize.minimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html).
- Matlabs `optim` toolbox provides the function [`fmincon`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html).
