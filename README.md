### Ideas for Models & Methods

For inspiration, we prepared a few models and methods that you can use as a starting point. 

Ideas for Models:
- [2D-XY Bicycle](documentation/Model%20-%202D-XY%20Bicycle%20Control.md)
- [2D-XZ Drone](documentation/Model%20-%202D-XZ%20Drone%20Control.md)
- [2D-XZ Rocket](documentation/Model%20-%202D-XZ%20Rocket%20Control.md)

Ideas for Methods:
- Open Loop
	- [Open Loop Planning](documentation/Method%20-%20Open%20Loop%20Planning.md)
- Closed Loop
	- [Linear Quadratic Regulator](documentation/Method%20-%20LQR%20Controller.md)
	- [Model Predictive Control](documentation/Method%20-%20Model%20Predictive%20Control.md)
	
For every of the models and the methods, we prepared examples, that you can use as a starting point.

### Tools & Installation

For this you need Hackathon, you will need python and an IDE installed on your computer.
We use the python framework [`CasAdi`](https://web.casadi.org/) to formulate OCPs.
If you already have Python installed on your system or want to use another IDE, feel free to skip to bullet 4.
