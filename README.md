Welcome to the hackathon ....
What is the goal of this hackathon? -> Students get a feeling for what kind of tasks/problems they might encounter, see the 'power of control' on simple examples.

You can do whatever you like or find interesting!

### Organisation
Timetable
- Day 1, 17:45-18:15, Introduction to Hackathon, find groups
- Until Day 2, 8:30, decide what project you want to work on
- Day 2, 8:30-12:30, Hackathon
- Day 2, 13:30 â€“ 14:15, Presentation of hackathon results by participants
Groups of 2-4 students, supervised by PhD students and Professors.

# Scenarios
For every scenario, we prepared python code that implements:
- the model equations
- an open-loop simulation (TODO: Picture of open loop system) with a nice visualization. The simulation requires a starting state and an open-loop control-strategy $u(t)$ as inputs.
  ```python
	def u_t(t):
		if t < 3:
			return 0
		else:
			return 1
			
	scenario.openLoopSimulation(x_0, u_t, t_f=10)
	```
- a close-loop simulation:
  ```python
	scenario.closedLoopSimulation(x_0, u_t, t_f=10)`
	```
